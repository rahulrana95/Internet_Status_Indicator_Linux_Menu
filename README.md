# Internet_Status_Indicator_Linux_Menu
It checks for internet connection and put icon as per it on menu bar on the top.
If internet is working fine it put a icon and else it put other icon.
To make it auto start with ubuntu follow these steps:..
1.add path of file *.py to /etc/rc.local with '&' at the end so it runs in background.
2. now go to search ,search startup manager and add rc.local file there.
3.Its done.
Now you can see icon in menu.
Yellow when net working fine and blackarrow when down.
Thank you.
